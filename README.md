# Solar_System_Simulator
Hello, this is my attempt to code a two dimensional solar system simulator. I had to overcome quite a few hurdles for a couple of days trying to code this project. This is programmed in C++ however, I am almost getting to the most accurate calculations. I am not entirely sure where the error is in my code. 

Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy reading through my code. I have also included a text file just to see what the output is like.
