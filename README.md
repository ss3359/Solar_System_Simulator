# Solar_System_Simulator
Hello, this is my attempt to code a two dimensional solar system simulator. I had to overcome quite a few hurdles for a couple of days trying to code this project. This is programmed in C++ however, I am almost getting to the most accurate calculations. I am not entirely sure where the error is in my code. The equations that are considered are Newtons Universal Law of Gravitation and Newtons Second Law Of Motion.

The Runge-Kutta method is used to iteate each step to update the position and velocity vector. 

UPDATE: As of today, 1/11/2025, I have refined the code to get the expected results for the velocity and the position, of the celestial bodies. I have looked at an example of looking at the position and the velocity of Earth. 

I hope you enjoy reading my project.
